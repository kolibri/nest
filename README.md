## Nest?

The metapher is about a birds nest. Birds lay eggs (like you may create new machines), they hatch it (like you provision your machines), and they teach the little birds to fly (like you throw you machines againts a wall, whem they don't do, what you think you told them)

Yeah, I like birds!
